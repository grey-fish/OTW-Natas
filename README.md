# Lets do this

Finally after solving 17 Levels of Natas, i have decided to make a separate repo dedicated to this beautiful Wargame. 

This repo will contain a rough writeup and a script (if needed) to solve the level. 


## Why do Natas
I've always loved security and recently picked up PHP. Natas is a wargame with PHP backend, and seems like a natural choice, plus i got way too much time on my hands (dont ask why). 


### Why make a repo
This repo serves two purpose
    - Help anyone who might struggle at any level and need assistance.
    - It serves as a Log Book for my future self.


That's it.
